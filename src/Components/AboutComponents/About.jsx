          My journey into the world of programming began in the my 11th grade
          comp sci course with my introduction to turing where I made a 2D
          pok√©mon like sprite game. Since then, I've been on an exciting
          adventure of continuous learning and growth. Throughout my career,
          I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects, from
          programming car navigation in assembly to developing full-stack
          applications.

          I'm currently focusing on front-end and full-stack development,
          specifically the within the React ecosystem; however, I'm always excited to dive
          into new technologies and frameworks. Outside of my love for
          programming I also golf, rock climb, workout and play the occasional game
          with friends.
